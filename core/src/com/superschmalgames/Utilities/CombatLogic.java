public class CombatLogic {
    //move combat initialization stuff from gamescreen's show() method to here, and also create a stats array
    //to use to pass to h_move's use() method. Every time we go to combat, we just create a new combat logic object
    //and have it reinitialize stuff and update the stat array.

    //Also need: state machine for handling turns, logic for player victory, logic for player death, npc decision-making
    //logic, etc.
